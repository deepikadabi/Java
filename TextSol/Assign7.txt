50.	Explain the importance of toString() and equals() method of the Object class and override them on class Employee(empId,name,salary).  a. Create class for main method(say XYZ),and accept five employees information and store in an array. Also ensure if entered empId already exist or not (use equals method).  b. Display all employee info using toString method.
