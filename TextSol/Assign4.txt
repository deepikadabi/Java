34.	Create a class Circle that has two data members, one to store the radius and another to store area and three methods first init() method to input radius from user, second calculateArea() method to calculate area of circle and third display() method to display values of radius and area. Create class CircleDemo ( main class) that creates the Circle object and calls init(), calculateArea() and display() methods.
> import java.util.Scanner;
class Circle{
    private int radius;
    private double area;
    void init(){
        System.out.println("Enter Radius : ");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        radius = sc.nextInt();
    }
    void area(){
       area = (double)(3.14*radius*radius);
    }
    void show(){
        System.out.println(area);
    }
}

public class CircleDemo {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
    Circle c = new Circle();
    c.init();
    c.area();
    c.show();
    
}
}

35.	Create a class MathOperation that has four static methods. add() method that takes two integer numbers as parameter and returns the sum of the numbers. subtract() method that takes two integer numbers as parameter and returns the difference of the numbers. multiply() method that takes two integer numbers as parameter and returns the product. power() method that takes two integer numbers as parameter and returns the power of first number to second number. Create another class Demo (main class) that takes the two numbers from the user and calls all four methods of MathOperation class by providing entered numbers and prints the return values of every method.
>   import java.util.Scanner;
import java.lang.Math;

class MathOpe{
    private int sum;
    private int sub;
    private int mul;
    private double pow;
    void sum(int a, int b){
        sum = a+b;
    }
    void sub(int a, int b){
        sub = a-b;
    }
    void mul(int a, int b){
        mul = a*b;
    }
    void pow(int a, int b){
        pow = Math.pow(a, b);
    }
    void show(){
        System.out.println(sum+"   "+sub+"   "+mul+"   "+pow);
    }
}

public class MathOp {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Entet two numbers : ");
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        MathOpe m = new MathOpe();
        m.sum(a, b);
        m.sub(a, b);
        m.mul(a, b);
        m.pow(a, b);
        m.show();
    }
}

36.	Create a class MathOperation containing overloaded methods ‘multiply’ to calculate multiplication of following arguments. 
    a.	 two integers 
    b.	 three floats 
    c.	 all elements of array 
    d.	one double and one integer 
37.	Create a class Person with properties (name and age) with following features. 
    a.	Default age of person should be 18.
    b.	A person object can be initialized with name and age.
    c.	Method to display name and age of person
Create another class PersonDemo ( main class ) that demonstrates the functionalities of Person class by creating Person object and calling methods.
38.	Create a class Employee with three data members (empNo, salary and totalSalary) and following features.
    a.	Only parameterized constructor. [Do not overload the constructor]
    b.	totalSalary always represents salary total of all the employees created.
    c.	empNo should be auto incremented.
    d.	display total employees and totalSalary using a method.
Create another class EmployeeDemo (main class) that creates some Employee objects and calls Employee method to display no. of employees and total of their salaries.
39.	Create class Product with three data members (pid, price, quantity) and parameterized constructor that takes values for all three data members.  
Create a main method in different class (say ProductDemo) and perform following task:
    a. Accept information for five Product objects from user and store objects in an array
    b. Find pid of product with highest price. 
    c. Create a static method (with array of product’s object as argument) in Product class to calculate and return total amount spent on all products. ( amount spent on single product = price of product * quantity of product )
40.	Create a class Student having data members name, roll no., age and score. Write a program to accept 10 records of student and store them in an array. And then arrange the student records based on the score group [0-50], [50-65], [65-80], [80-100].
