What is JDK?

How many memory locations are allocated by JVM?
=>	The memory in the JVM is divided into five different parts namely− 
	Method area− The method area stores the class code − code of the variables and methods.
	Heap − The Java objects are created in this area. 
	Java Stack− While running methods the results are stored in the stack memory


Why is JAVA Platform Independent?

What is class loader?

How do you create array in JAVA?

If I create an array of Strings. Can I store integer value in it.

While defining an array Can i give a negative number.

Can I pass a string to switch statement?

Why array index starts at 0

Array name is a constant pointer pointing to the base address.
When you use arr[i] the compiler manipulates it as *(arr+i).
Since int range is -128 to 127,the compiler thinks that 
-128 to -1 are negative numbers and 0 to 128 are positive numbers.
So array index always starts with zero


Why do we need JDK?

What is difference between JIT and interpreter?

What are packages?

Can we run a program without main?

What is class path?

Suppose I want to change the name of main() function
=>	Yes,We can change the name of the main method if we can change the configurations 
	of the JVM and let it look for a method with another name instead of main method.

	At start JVM is looking from method public static void main with array of Strings as argument. 
	So only thing you can do is rename argument args. 
	If you want method like boot nobody stops you from doing something like this 
	(personally I don't recommend that "pattern")


Explain public static void main()

When is main method called?
javac filename.java 	or 	java filename
compile time		or	runtime
=> Runtime
